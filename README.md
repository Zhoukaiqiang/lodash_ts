# lodash_ts

lodash_ts is the typescript version of lodash. It's just a rough imitation of lodash, and may behave differently (I'm committed to smoothing that out) and may be more modern.

Using pnpm:

## Why Lodash?

Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays,<br>
numbers, objects, strings, etc. Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

 * Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
 * Manipulating & testing values
 * Creating composite functions
